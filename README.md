## Master‚Äôs Thesis üìú
- **The Scalable Spatial Echo State Network for Detection of Anomalous Ocean Surface Topography**  
  **Supervisor:** James Avery (avery@nbi.dk)  
  **Description:** Developed a linearly-scalable echo-state RNN for high-dimensional spatio-temporal forecasting without knowing the governing PDEs. Built an adaptive anomaly detector for ocean transitions, training on years of simulation data in minutes with one-shot (no gradient) updates.  
  **Grade:** 12 / A
